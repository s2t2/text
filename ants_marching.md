He wakes up in the morning
Does his teeth, bite to eat, and he's rollin
Never changes a thing
The week ends, the week begins

She thinks, we look at each other
Wonderin what the other is thinking
But we never say a thing
As these crimes between us grow deeper

Take these chances  
Place them in a box until a quieter time  
Lights down, you up and die  

Goes to visit his mommy  
She feeds him well his concerns he forgets them  
And remembers being small  
Playing under the table and dreaming  

Take these chances  
Place them in a box until a quieter time  
Lights down, you up and die  

Driving in on this highway  
All these cars and upon the sidewalk  
People in every direction  
No words exchanged, no time to exchange  

Oh, when all the little ants are marching  
Red and black antennae waving  
They all do it the same  
They all do it the same...way  

Candyman tempting the thoughts of a  
Sweet tooth tortured by weight loss  
Program cutting the corners  
A Loose end, loose end cut cut  
On the fence, but not to offend  
Cut cut, cut cut  

Take these chances  
Place them in a box until a quieter time  
Lights down, you up and die  

Lights down you up and die
